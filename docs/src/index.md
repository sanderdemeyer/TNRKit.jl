You can use TNRKit for calculating:
1. Partition functions (classical & quantum)

# Quick Start Guide
1. Choose a (TensorKit!) tensor that respects the leg-convention (see below)
2. Choose a TNR scheme
3. Choose a truncation scheme
4. Choose a stopping criterion

For example:
```julia
using TNRKit, TensorKit

T = classical_ising(ising_βc) # partition function of classical Ising model at the critical point
scheme = BTRG(T) # Bond-weighted TRG (excellent choice)
data = run!(scheme, truncrank(16), maxiter(25)) # max bond-dimension of 16, for 25 iterations
```
`data` now contains 26 norms of the tensor, 1 for every time the tensor was normalized. (By default there is a normalization step before the first coarse-graining step wich can be turned off by changing the kwarg `run!(...; finalize_beginning=false)`)

Using these norms you could, for example, calculate the free energy of the critical classical Ising model:
```Julia
f = free_energy(data, ising_βc) # -2.1096504926141826902647832
```
You could even compare to the exact value, as calculated by the [Onsager solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model#:~:text=Onsager%27s%20exact%20solution):

```julia-repl
julia> abs((f - f_onsager) / f_onsager)
3.1e-07
```
Pretty impressive for a calculation that takes about 0.3s on a laptop.

## Verbosity
There are 3 levels of verbosity implemented in TNRKit:
- Level 0: no TNRKit messages whatsoever.
- Level 1: Info at beginning and end of the simulations (including information on why the simulation stopped, how long it took and how many iterations were performed).
- Level 2: Level 1 + info at every iteration about the last generated finalize output and the iteration number.
  
to choose the verbosity level, simply use `run!(...; verbosity=n)`. The default is `verbosity=1`.

## Included Models on the square lattice
TNRKit includes several common models out of the box.
- Ising model in 2D: `classical_ising(S, β; h=0)` where `S` can be `Trivial` or `Z2Irrep` to specify the symmetry.
- Ising model in 2D with impurities: `classical_ising_impurity(β; h=0)`.
- Ising model in 3D: `classical_ising_3D(S, β; h=0)` where `S` can be `Trivial` or `Z2Irrep` to specify the symmetry.
- Potts model in 2D: `classical_potts(S, q, β)`, where `S` can be `Trivial` or `ZNIrrep{q}` to specify the symmetry.
- Potts model in 2D with impurities: `classical_potts_impurity(q, β)`.
- Six Vertex model: `sixvertex(S, elt; a=1.0, b=1.0, c=1.0)` where `S` can be `Trivial`, `U1Irrep` or `CU1Irrep` to specify the symmetry and `elt` can be any number type (default is `Float64`).
- Clock model: `classical_clock(S, q, β)` where `S` can be `Trivial`, `ZNIrrep{q}` or `DNIrrep{q}` to specify the symmetry.
- XY model in 2D: `classical_XY(S, β, charge_trunc)` where `S` can be `U1Irrep` or `CU1Irrep` to specify the symmetry.
- Real $\phi^4$ model: `phi4_real(S, K, μ0, λ, h)` where `S` can be `Trivial` or `Z2Irrep` to specify the symmetry.
- Real $\phi^4$ model with impurities: `phi4_real_imp1(S, K, μ0, λ, h)` and `phi4_real_imp2(S, K, μ0, λ, h)` where `S` can be `Trivial`.
- Complex $\phi^4$ model: `phi4_complex(S, K, μ0, λ)` where `S` can be `Trivial`, `Z2Irrep ⊠ Z2Irrep` or `U1Irrep` to specify the symmetry.
- Gross-Neveu model: `gross_neveu_start(S, μ, m, g)` where `S` can be `FermionParity` to specify the symmetry.

## Included Models on the triangular lattice
TNRKit includes several common models out of the box.
- Ising model: `classical_ising_triangular(S, β; h=0)` where `S` can be `Trivial` or `Z2Irrep` to specify the symmetry.

## Included Models on the honeycomb lattice
TNRKit includes several common models out of the box.
- Ising model: `classical_ising_honeycomb(S, β; h=0)` where `S` can be `Trivial` or `Z2Irrep` to specify the symmetry.
  
If you want to implement your own model you must respect the leg-convention assumed by all TNRKit schemes.

## Leg-convention
All the schemes assume that the input tensor lives in the space $V_1 \otimes V_2 \leftarrow V_3 \otimes V_4$ and that the legs are ordered in the following way:
```
     3
     |
     v
     |
1-<--┼--<-4
     |
     v
     |
     2
```

The 3D scheme(s) assume that the input tensor lives in the space $V_{\text{D}} \otimes V_{\text{U}} \prime \leftarrow V_{\text{N}} \otimes V_{\text{E}} \otimes V_{\text{S}} \prime \otimes V_{\text{W}} \prime$.

Where D, U, N, E, S, W stand for Down, Up, North, East, South and West.
